# User Interface Module

This folder contains all classes relating to the user interface.

## Libraries and Frameworks

The UI is entirely built on Bootstrap, with custom styling for
some elements and the page layout.

Primary libraries used:

- **Bootstrap**: v2
- **jQuery**
- **jQuery UI**
- **FontAwesome**: v5

## The Working Principle

There are two main aspects to the UI system:

- [The UI helper classes](Docs/ui-helper-classes.md) - A helper class for each Bootstrap UI element
- [The Theming layer](Docs/themes-and-templates.md) - Themes with PHP-Based templates
