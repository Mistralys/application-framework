# Themes and Templates

## PHP-Based templates

The Themes do not use any known templating engine. Instead,
each template is a PHP class that renders HTML code. 
The philosophy behind this is that PHP is a template language
by design, so the system just facilitates using it this way.

## Template Inheritance and Overrides

Templates defined in the Framework can be overridden in the
application.
