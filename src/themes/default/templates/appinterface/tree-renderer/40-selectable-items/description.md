Marking a tree renderer's items as selectable with the `makeNodeSelectable()`
method adds checkboxes to items, so they can be selected. Nodes can be given
a value with `setValue()`, which is used if the form is submitted.

> If a node is not given any target, its label is automatically
> used as label for the checkbox.
