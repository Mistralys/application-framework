The grid's size can be reduced to a compact layout to fit more
items on the screen. The most compact layout can be achieved by 
turning off the header row and footers as well.

> NOTE: Set up like this, the grid is a pure layout element and 
> does not have any functionality. It is recommended to disable 
> the grid's form as well for consistency.
