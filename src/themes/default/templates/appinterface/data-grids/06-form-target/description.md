The target of a data grid's form can be set with `setFormTarget()`. 
Setting this to `_blank` will cause all grid actions to be submitted
in a new browser tab. The utility method `enableSubmitInNewTab()`
used in the example below is shorthand for this.

The grid's actions can override this individually. For example, the
following grid has been set to open in a new tab. However, some actions 
in the grid have been configured to open in the same tab.

Use the action menu to see this in action.
