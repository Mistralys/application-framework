The target of a data grid action can be set with `setFormTarget()`. 
Setting this to `_blank` will cause the grid's form to be submitted
in a new browser tab. 

To illustrate, some actions in the following grid have been set to 
open in a new tab. Use the action menu to see this in action.
The values selected in the grid will be shown in a UI message.
