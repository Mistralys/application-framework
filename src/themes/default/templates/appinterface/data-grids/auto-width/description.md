By default, all data grids will fill the entire available space. 
This can be changed by enabling auto-width mode using the 
`makeAutoWidth()` method. This will make the grid use the width 
of its content.

**NOTE**: **Do not give columns any width**, as this will cause the
grid to ignore the auto-width setting. It defeats the purpose of
using auto-width mode.
