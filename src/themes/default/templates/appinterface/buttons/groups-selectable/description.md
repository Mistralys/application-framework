A button group can act like tabs by selecting an active button.
In this example, the active button is selected via a request parameter,
but it can also be selected manually with the `selectByName()` method.

> NOTE: For this to work, every button has to be given a unique name
> to recognize them by.

Click a button to have it selected via the request parameter.
