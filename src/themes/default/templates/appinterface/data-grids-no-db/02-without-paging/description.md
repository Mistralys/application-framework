This is a data grid used to display a list of entries
without any paging controls. It shows the basic usage
of how to add entries to the grid.

> NOTE: Data grid columns do not contain definitions for how their
  cells are formatted. Instead, the formatting of cells is 
  done manually when the array of entries is built.
