Confirmation buttons display a confirmation dialog when clicked. 
They are used to prevent accidental actions and to inform the
user about what will happen when they click the button.

When the user confirms the action, the button's action (link,
JavaScript statement, etc.) is executed. 

> Both buttons work: They simply refresh the page.
