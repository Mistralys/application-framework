Sections in the sidebar have the same capabilities as 
regular content sections. The `addSection()` method 
is just a helper method to add a section instance to 
the sidebar.

The only difference is that the headings of sidebar 
sections do not have a solid background color, to avoid
the sidebar looking too cluttered (only collapsible
sections have one, when hovering over the heading).
