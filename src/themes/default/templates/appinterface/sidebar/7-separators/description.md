The separators in the sidebar are intelligent: they will 
only appear if there is at least one item above and below 
them. This includes checking the visibility of all the
surrounding items.

They will also ensure that there are no duplicate separators.

In this example, the button Nr. 2 is hidden, so the separator
above it is also hidden to show only one separator between the
buttons that are left.
