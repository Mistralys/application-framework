The step navigator is used to display the steps of a process. 
It is mainly used in the wizard screens to display the wizard's
steps, but can be used as a standalone component as well.

**NOTE: The steps are disabled by default.** They must be enabled
manually to be clickable. The same applies to the active step,
as the navigator has no logic to handle this.
