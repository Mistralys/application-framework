Sections can be assigned to groups to make the collapse 
controls work with those groups instead of all sections. 

The controls are not shown automatically.
For UI flexibility, a helper method is provided to generate 
the controls, so you can display them where you want them.

> NOTE: In forms, the controls are automatically generated.
