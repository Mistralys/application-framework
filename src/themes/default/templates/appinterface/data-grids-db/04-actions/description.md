Grid actions can be used to apply custom actions to any selected
items in the data grid. For this, the multi-select mode is enabled,
and every action must be assigned a callback method to process the
selected items accordingly.

Try selecting one or more items in the grid below, and then select
an action to execute from the action menu. A success message will
be shown with the details.
