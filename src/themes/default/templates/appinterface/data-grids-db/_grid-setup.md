This is used by the examples for the basic data grid setup.

It configures the available columns and the necessary 
request variables to make it possible to sort it and use
the pagination controls (which are submitted through the
grid's form).

It also fills the test DB record tables with some greek
mythology figures to use in the grid.

**It does not generate any outputâ€”look at the code instead.**
