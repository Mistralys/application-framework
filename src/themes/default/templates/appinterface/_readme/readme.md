The rendering of the examples is done in the `ExampleTemplate` class.
Individual examples are handled by the `ExampleFile` class.

Available variables in all examples:

- `$activeExampleID` the ID of the currently active example.
- `$activeURL` the ID of the current example.

> NOTE: Additionally, static methods of `ExampleFile` can be used.
