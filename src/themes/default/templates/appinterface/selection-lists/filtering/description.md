The filtering can be enabled to display a field that filters
the items on the client side by calling the `enableFiltering()`
method. The filter searches both in the item label and in the
description.

The filtering can then be limited to be enabled automatically 
when a specific number of items is reached. This can be 
configured with the method `setFilteringThreshold()`.
