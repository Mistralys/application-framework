To avoid overflow in case of long lists, the UI height can be limited
to an arbitrary CSS height value. This forces scrollbars to appear
if the list is too long.

In the example, the height is limited to `300px`.

> The list wrapper gets the class `bigselection-height-limited`, which
> handles some tweaks to make it look good.
