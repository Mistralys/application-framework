# AppFramework - Admin UI

The Application Framework is a PHP-based UI framework for building frontends for web 
and intranet tools. 

## Installation

Automatic handling of local development instances can be automated with the
[Framework Manager][], which is currently still a private project. Setup 
documentation is not available yet.

## Documentation

The framework's documentation is available locally by pointing a browser in 
the `docs` folder, and online in the separate [Framework Documentation][]
package. 

> It is ideally viewed through the framework's documentation screen, as there
> are some features that are only available there (like code samples that are
> included dynamically).
