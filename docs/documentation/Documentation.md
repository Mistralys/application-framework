# Introduction

The framework provides the underlying application structure,
from the user authentication and administration screens to the
UI theming. It is a custom framework that is not based on any
known frameworks: it grew from the original development of 
several intranet tools until 2019, when it was separated into 
its own project.

## Responsibilities

The framework is responsible for many of the underlying tasks that
a web or console application may need. This includes, but is not 
limited to:

- Creating the working environment of a request.
- Providing the base skeleton of end user screens.
- Providing finished, common end user screens.  
- Providing a unified UI and templating layer.
- Providing a localization layer.
- Providing structural elements for handling data.
- Giving access to common development tools.
